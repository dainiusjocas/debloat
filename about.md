The goal of this project is to find out how to develop software that would contain only the useful features.

The reality is that successful application gets more and more features as time goes on. This leads to the situation when an application contains features that adds little or no value to the application. The obvious thing to do is to get rid of those useless features but the problem is that this task is as complicated as to introduce new features. The consequence is bloatware.

So, I'm going to focus my best efforts to find a solution how to remove features from an application in an elegant and efficient way.
